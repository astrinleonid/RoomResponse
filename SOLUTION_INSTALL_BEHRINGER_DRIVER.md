# Solution: Install Behringer Native Driver for UMC1820

## Problem Summary

The UMC1820 fails to record multi-channel audio through SDL/WASAPI on your current computer, but works perfectly on another computer with the **native Behringer driver installed**.

## Root Cause

Your current computer is using **Windows generic USB Audio Class 2.0 driver**, which has severe limitations:

- ✗ WDM/WASAPI mode is **limited to 2 channels (stereo)** only
- ✗ Multi-channel input (10 channels) is **not accessible** through generic driver
- ✗ Windows generic driver does NOT expose full device capabilities to WASAPI

The other computer has **Behringer's native driver**, which provides:

- ✓ Full **18 input / 20 output** channel access through WDM/WASAPI
- ✓ ASIO driver for low-latency professional audio
- ✓ Proper channel configuration for Windows audio APIs
- ✓ MIDI driver support

## The Solution: Install Behringer Native Driver

### Step 1: Download the Driver

**Latest Version**: 5.57.0.27269 (May 11, 2023)

**Download from**:
- **Official Behringer**: https://www.behringer.com/downloads.html
  - Search for "UMC1820"
  - Download "UMC Driver" for Windows

**Alternative versions**:
- Version 4.59.0.56775 (March 14, 2019) - Tested and stable
- Version 4.38.0.0 (February 20, 2018) - Older stable version

### Step 2: Uninstall Generic Driver (if needed)

1. Open Device Manager (Win+X → Device Manager)
2. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers"
3. Find "UMC1820" or "USB Audio Device"
4. Right-click → "Uninstall device"
5. Check "Delete the driver software for this device"
6. Click "Uninstall"
7. Unplug UMC1820

### Step 3: Install Behringer Driver

1. Run downloaded installer (e.g., `UMC-Driver_4-59-0.zip`)
2. Extract and run setup executable
3. Follow installation wizard
4. The installer will install **3 components**:
   - **ASIO Driver** (for DAWs and professional audio software)
   - **WDM Driver** (for Windows applications like SDL/WASAPI)
   - **MIDI Driver** (for MIDI functionality)
5. Restart computer after installation
6. Plug in UMC1820

### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. Open Device Manager
2. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers"
3. You should see:
   - "BEHRINGER UMC1820" (with Behringer driver)
   - NOT "USB Audio Device" (generic driver)

4. Check in Windows Sound Settings:
   - Right-click speaker icon → "Sounds"
   - "Recording" tab → You should see "UMC1820"
   - Right-click → "Properties" → "Advanced" tab
   - You should see multi-channel options available

### Step 5: Test with Our Application

1. Run our test script:
   ```
   .venv/Scripts/python.exe test_umc_input_detailed.py
   ```

2. Expected results after driver installation:
   ```
   ✓ 1 channels requested → SUCCESS
   ✓ 2 channels requested → SUCCESS
   ✓ 8 channels requested → SUCCESS
   ✓ 10 channels requested → SUCCESS
   ```

3. Run the full application and test Calibration Impulse

## What the Behringer Driver Does Differently

### Windows Generic USB Audio Class 2.0 Driver
```
Input:  2 channels only (stereo)
Output: 2 channels only (stereo)
ASIO:   Not available
SDL:    Sees 10 channels but can't open them (driver limitation)
```

### Behringer Native WDM Driver
```
Input:  18 channels (full multi-channel access)
Output: 20 channels (full multi-channel access)
ASIO:   Available (dedicated ASIO driver)
SDL:    Can properly open and use all channels via WASAPI
```

## Technical Explanation

The Windows generic driver implements USB Audio Class 2.0 specification, which **reports** device capabilities (like "10 channels") but the actual WDM/WASAPI interface is **hardcoded to stereo (2 channels)** only.

Behringer's native driver:
1. Properly exposes all channels through WDM kernel interface
2. Implements correct WASAPI mix format for multi-channel
3. Allows `IAudioClient::GetMixFormat()` to return correct channel count
4. Works with SDL's WASAPI backend without requiring special flags

## Why It Works on the Other Computer

The other computer has:
- Behringer native driver installed
- Proper WDM/WASAPI multi-channel support
- SDL can successfully open UMC1820 with any channel count (1-10)
- No workarounds or patches needed

## Troubleshooting

### If driver installation fails:
1. Completely uninstall old driver from Device Manager
2. Unplug UMC1820
3. Restart computer
4. Install Behringer driver
5. Restart again
6. Plug in UMC1820

### If multi-channel still doesn't work after installation:
1. Check Device Manager shows "BEHRINGER UMC1820" not "USB Audio Device"
2. Try different USB port
3. Check Windows Update didn't reinstall generic driver
4. In Device Manager, right-click UMC1820 → "Update driver" → "Browse my computer" → Select Behringer driver folder

### If Windows keeps reverting to generic driver:
1. Device Manager → UMC1820 → Properties → Driver tab
2. Click "Update Driver"
3. "Browse my computer for drivers"
4. "Let me pick from a list of available drivers"
5. Select "BEHRINGER UMC1820" (not "USB Audio Device")

## Expected Performance After Fix

With Behringer driver installed:

**Multi-channel Recording:**
- ✓ 1-10 channel recording works
- ✓ All channel combinations functional
- ✓ No "Invalid source channels" errors
- ✓ SDL WASAPI backend works correctly

**Application Features:**
- ✓ Calibration Impulse test works
- ✓ Multi-channel piano response recording works
- ✓ Phase 2 and Phase 3 functionality fully operational
- ✓ Can use UMC1820 as both input and output

**Additional Benefits:**
- Lower latency (ASIO available if needed later)
- Better audio quality
- Professional-grade stability
- MIDI support enabled

## Recommended Driver Version

**For Windows 10/11**: Version 4.59.0.56775 or newer (5.57.0.27269)

**For Windows 7/8**: Version 4.38.0.0

## Summary

**The fix is simple**: Install Behringer's native driver instead of using Windows generic USB audio driver. This is **not a workaround** - this is how the device is meant to be used for multi-channel audio on Windows.

The Windows generic USB Audio Class 2.0 driver is designed for basic stereo audio compatibility. Professional multi-channel audio interfaces like the UMC1820 **require their native drivers** to unlock full functionality.

After installing the driver, all your multi-channel recording features should work exactly as they do on the other computer.
